			<p>[Note: use this section to make a brief, general statement about what the website allows disabled users to do. Base it on the evaluation covered in detail in the ‘Technical information about this website’s accessibility’ section. If you’re not confident that something is accurate, leave it out. If you’re not confident enough to say anything specific here, leave this section out completely.]</p>
			</div>

			<p>This website is run by HM Land Registry.  We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website.  For example, that means you should be able to:</p>

			<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
			  <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
			  <li>zoom in up to 200% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
			  <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
			  <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
			  <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
			</ul>

			<p>We&apos;ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.</p>

			<div class="call-to-action">
			<p>[Note: use this section to provide information that a disabled user can act on - for example, avoid a particular section of the website, or request an alternative version rather than waste time trying to make it work with their assistive technology. Try to list in order of most impact to least impact.]</p>
