# Whats this repo for?

I wanted an html version of a gov service sample accessibilty statement to copy / paste from, and play around with - to use in prototypes, and help content designers, front end, and testers make the real thing.

This repo is a copy of the gov prototype kit 9.5

The sample accessibilty statement is from gov.uk: 
[https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sample-accessibility-statement](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sample-accessibility-statement) 

my aim is to make a html - gov markedup, template page - with the guidance notes removed - a boilerplate page ready to insert the results of accessibilty testing from any project i work on.

## To Do

* add the statement and code (with instructions) to drop into any kit page
* check the markup is: semantically correct, uses the design system markup and css
* accessiiblity check the page
