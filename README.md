# Whats this repo for?

The obvious thing to have is your standard template accessibility statement in HTML (in your design system/front end toolkit) ready to be tweaked and content added for an individual service.

Mainly created for designers to drop into a prototype, so content design can work with people to create the services statement.  Easy then to copy paste that HTML into a front end, as the template is proven HTML / gov class marked-up.
